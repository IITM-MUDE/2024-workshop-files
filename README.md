# Workshop Files

The goal of this repository is to:
- share files with workshop participants
- set up an FTP-style page
- illustrate the MUDE file creation workflow
- share presentation slides from workshop with participants

The MUDE files workflow is not the _best_ way, but it is certainly _a_ way. It utilizes a single repository where source code (e.g., notebooks) are edited and HTML files are generated for reading online (and in this case deployed via the same repository). The source code in this repo is what is used to create the GitHub Classroom assignments. In this demonstration (workshop), the solutions are technially also shared in the `teachers` subdirectory; however, in a real course this would of course need to be hidden from students.

This repository uses [php-directory-listing](https://github.com/caendesilva/php-directory-listing) by Caen De Silva.

_Note: the `.src/.` subdirectory and its contents were intended to illustrate the MUDE workflow for creating assignment materials and were not covered as part of the workshop. An improved solution for handling files will be shared elsewhere in the future. Get in touch with Robert if you would like to find out more._

**All relevant files for the workshop are shared via the `./students/` subdirectory. The others can be ignored.**
