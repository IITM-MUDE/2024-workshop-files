# README

This is the "Files Page" for MUDE in Madras. It is used for you to quickly read the contents of various assignment files used in the course. The source code for these assignments will be accessed and submitted via GitHub repositories. The links to access each assignment are provided in the respective README files.

**Notes to participants**

Originally this website was meant to be used as a student, but now it has other workshop participant files, including:

- workshop presentation slides in directory `Workshop-Slides`
- two `*.yml` files to create conda environments (one as a student, the other for book editing)

See the [workshop summary page](https://iitm-mude.github.io/2024-workshop/summary) for additional information.
